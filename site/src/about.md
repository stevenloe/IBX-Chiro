## I love helping people.

I believe that life is about balance. I am here to help!  In the 23 years I’ve been a Chiropractor, I have merged my abilities and training into a practice that’s led thousands of people to relief from pain, to better health, and greater balance. I am proud of the work I do, and take tremendous joy in seeing my patients regain abilities lost through injury, progress through challenges and grow more confident. I want every one of my patients to succeed in the goals they set with me as well as goals they set independently. I am delighted to see them achieve success everyday in my practice.

>>  ## My approach
>>  I combine  chiropractic adjustments with many modalities including physical therapy  modalities, stretching, soft tissue work and therapeutic exercise.  I want to make sure your entire spine is right, not just where it hurts. Often we’ll find that your knee injury is contributing to your low back pain. Or your shoulder or elbow injury is affecting your neck stability. If that’s the case, I work with the mechanics of your extra ties in order to improve the mechanics of your body as a whole.  It’s all connected. You are so much more than just your neck or low back pain.

Your nervous system coordinates every conscious and unconscious function in your body. Sometimes the flow of these neurological messages becomes blocked, and can’t do their job of keeping organs and muscles functioning optimally. 

Chiropractic adjustments help your body move by increasing spinal & joint mobility. This creates a healthier nervous system and improved body function. In addition, adjustments activate the innate intelligence of the nervous system, remove nerve interference, and enhance the flow of energy throughout the body promoting health and vitality. I have an extensive knowledge of biomechanics, anatomy and physiology, which allows me to blend chiropractic adjustments, physical therapy and stretching / strengthening exercises.

Let’s talk about basic posture, and how not to let gravity get the best of you. I want to talk about what we can do to get you in the best possible health. 

You can expect direct and punctual communication with me via telephone or email. I wear most of the hats in my office. If you call and get voicemail, I’m probably with a patient. Leave me a message. I’ll get back to you right away!

## Initial visit

I run a small, service-oriented health care practice. That means that you can expect me to really listen to your story. I want to know how I can help you. We’ll spend time going through the history of you in order to put the full picture together. What’s making you hurt today might be related to something in your past. During our 30-45 minutes together, we’ll discuss your health goals, evaluate your range of mobility and test your nervous system for numbness, tingling or unevenness of sensation.  I want to know about what treatment you’ve had in the past— what’s worked and what hasn’t. Finally, I’ll do your first treatment.

>> ## Regular visits
>>Once we’ve figured out what makes you tick (or what’s keeping you from ticking properly) in your initial visit, I’ll give you my assessment, and make a specific plan of action to get you to your health goal. We will work on your plan during each visit. Follow up visits are usually 20-30 minutes.

## My services

Chiropractors are experts at getting you you moving again. We know that as humans we are living, dynamic, self-regulating beings. This means you have the innate ability to heal and stay well. Sometimes life catches up with you and knocks you off kilter. Life is full of physical, emotional stresses that can accumulate. Your body may feel tired, achy, not at a level of vitality you expect. You literally feel it in your bones. 

After careful evaluation treatment will most likely include:    
**Chiropractic Spinal adjustment:** The application of a very controlled, rapid force to realign the vertebral joint, thus restoring optimal motion.    
**Chiropractic Extremity Adjustment:** Think of all the stress you put in your elbows, knees, wrists and feet. They can get out of alignment, too.    
**Myofascial Release:** Deep tissue massage used to break muscle patterns that may interfere with the efficacy of the adjustment.   
**Therapeutic modalities** including application of electricity to alter dysfunctional neuromuscular function, therapeutic ultrasound and exercise and therapeutic rehabilitation. 

## Motor vehicle accidents

Often times you can be involved in something traumatic and outside of your control.  These types of injuries usually involve multiple areas of your body where the damage is unseen to the naked eye especially to the muscle ligament joint complex.  You can expect to be sore and often people delay treatment when early chiropractic care can be very beneficial. There is tremendous inflammation, pain, stiffness and often headache pain.  

After an accident, you’ll have inflammation and scar tissue starting to form. This often leads to pain, stiffness,  and headaches. My care gets right to the root of the problem: working with with tight or injured muscles, encouraging them to release, realigning misaligned bones, and getting you out of pain and moving again.

## Sports injuries, mechanics, injury prevention

Whether you are an Olympic athlete or looking to improve your pickle ball performance or agility on your sail boat, chiropractic care can help you get back on your game. I am here to help you improve your quality of life.  I’ve worked with many high level athletes, helping them recover from injuries, improve mechanics, range of motion and prevent further injury.

## About me
I was born in Saratoga Springs NY but I spent most of my youth in Connecticut.  From a very early age, I knew I wanted to work helping others become more healthy. Originally I’d planned to go to medical school —hence taking four years of latin in High School. When I was older, met a chiropractor who had a profound influence on my career.  When I was completing my undergraduate requirements,  I met a chiropractor in South Windsor CT.  He was the first  practitioner that showed me the keys to respecting all medical specialists and finding our role in maintaining and facilitating wellness for patients.  

At the same time, I found that I was becoming more interested in non-traditional medial care. I’m fascinated with how the human body works.  I can completely *geek out* about anatomy, biomechanics, neurology, gait analysis, orthopedics and the healing process. I enjoy reading up on the latest research on chiropractic care, manual medicine, pain management, neurology and public health initiatives.   

I received my Doctorate of Chiropractic from National College of Chiropractic, Lombard IL in 1997, my Bachelor of Science in Human Biology, 1996. 

I’ve worked as a chiropractor or instructor of chiropractic in Chicago, Long Beach, CA, and Hartford, CT. For more, [see my CV.](/cv/) I speak Spanish fluently.

I have a longstanding connection to Pamlico county. I have family here and began visiting the area in 2009.  I’ve always enjoyed the diverse group of people who live here. The peacefulness and beauty of the area have long been a welcome break from city life. Like of many people I meet in the area, there came a point where my family and I felt it was time for a change. We moved to Oriental in 2019.

In my personal time, I often read or watch a movie with my family to relax. I love to fish and spend time in the outdoors and cook. I enjoy boating with my family and generally just enjoying all that Pamlico County has to offer.
